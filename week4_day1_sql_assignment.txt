SQL Exercise

So much SQL

Create The Tables

CREATE a new table named teacher with the following columns

teacherId INT
firstName VARCHAR
lastNmae VARCHAR
age INT
salary DECIMAL
CREATE a new table named student with the following columns

studentId INT
firstName VARCHAR
lastName VARCHAR
grade INT
gpa DECIMAL
CREATE a new table named class with the following columns

classId INT
name VARCHAR
description VARCHAR
teacherId INT
CREATE a new table named classStudent with the following columns

classStudentId INT
classId INT
studentId INT
Create The Data

Now you have your tables created, lets populate them with data.

1. INSERT three different teachers into the teacher table

INSERT INTO `week4_sql_assignment`.`teacher`

(`first_name`,
`last_name`,
`age`,
`salary`)

VALUES

('Sarah', 'Thomas', 38, 37960.75),

('Ronald', 'Washington', 56, 63780.30),

('Susana', 'Lopez', 44, 52120.15);


2. Now INSERT two different classes for each teacher in the class table (that will be six classes)

INSERT INTO `week4_sql_assignment`.`class`

(`name`, `description`, `teacher_id`)

VALUES
('Algebra 1', 'This is an introduction to Algebra and it will cover all the basic Algebra concepts.', 2),

('Calculus 1', 'This class will cover basic calculus topics for high school students.', 1),

('Calculus 2', 'An intermediate Calculus class covering differential calculus and integral calculus. Prerequisites: Calculus 1', 2),

('Contemporary English Writing', 'An introductory English writing for the 21th century modern era.', 3),

('World Literature', 'This class will cover the varios styles and categories of literature writings in the world.', 3),

('Introductory Biology', 'This is an introductory biology class that will cover the basic concepts of biology including living and non-living things', 1);



3. INSERT ten students in the student table

INSERT INTO `week4_sql_assignment`.`student`

(`first_name`, `last_name`, `grade`, `gpa`)

VALUES

('Keshia', 'McDonald', 11, 3.642),
('Mary', 'Simone', 11, 3.205),

('George', 'Trump', 10, 3.733),

('Mary', 'Daniel', 11, 3.128),

('Kyle', 'Williams', 12, 2.40),

('Kevin', 'Solomon', 9, 1.572),

('Brenda', 'Bush', 12, 2.60),

('Lateisha', 'Mitchell', 9, 3.27),

('Serena', 'Clinton', 10, 3.421),

('Marianne', 'Gongalez', 12, 3.531);


The classStudent table is known as a linking table. It allows us to have a many-to-many relationship between classes and students. The class table includes a column for teacherId. This means each class can only have one teacher. But if this is a regular school a class can have any number of students and students can have any number of classes. This n-to-n relationship is called many-to-many in the database world.

In the classStudent table INSERT rows for each student. INSERT 1, 2, or 3 classes for each student

INSERT INTO `week4_sql_assignment`.`class_student`

(`class_id`, `student_id`)

VALUES

(2, 1),
(5, 1),
(6, 1),

(2, 2),
(6, 2),

(1, 3),
(4, 3),

(2, 4),
(6, 4),

(3, 5),
(5, 5),

(1, 6),
(4, 6),
(6, 6),

(3, 7),

(2, 8),
(6, 8),

(1, 9),
(4, 9),

(3, 10),
(5, 10);


COPY ALL OF THE STATMENTS YOU ARE ABOUT TO MAKE INTO A .TXT FILE

If you forget the assignment will be incomplete

Query The Data

1. SELECT all teachers

SELECT * FROM week4_sql_assignment.teacher;


2. SELECT all classes

SELECT * FROM week4_sql_assignment.class;


3. SELECT all students

SELECT * FROM week4_sql_assignment.student;


4. SELECT all classes for teacher 1

SELECT * FROM week4_sql_assignment.class
 WHERE teacher_id = 1;


5. SELECT all students for class 1

SELECT * FROM week4_sql_assignment.class_student WHERE class_id = 1;


6. SELECT all classes for student 1

SELECT * FROM week4_sql_assignment.class_student WHERE student_id = 1;


7. SELECT all students who's first name starts with a or b

SELECT * FROM week4_sql_assignment.student 
WHERE first_name LIKE 'b%';


Update Data

1. UPDATE teacher 1's name to Superman

UPDATE `week4_sql_assignment`.`teacher`
SET

`last_name` = 'Superman' 

WHERE `teacher_id` = 1;


2. Update class 1's name to Underwater Basket Weaving

UPDATE `week4_sql_assignment`.`class`
SET

`name` = 'Underwater Basket Weaving'

WHERE `class_id` = 1;


3. Update Student 1's name to Wonder Woman

UPDATE `week4_sql_assignment`.`student`

SET

`last_name` = 'Wonder Woman'

WHERE `student_id` = 1;


Delete Data

1. DELETE student 10

DELETE FROM `week4_sql_assignment`.`student`
WHERE `student_id` = 10;


Finally!

Export each of the tables to a .csv file dump all of them plus your .txt file containing your statments into a folder and push it to github!
